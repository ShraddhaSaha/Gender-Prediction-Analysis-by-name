This is my Internship work on Gender Prediction Analysis by name using MS Excel during my Data Science and Analytics internship at DataPlay.

I achieved the following Macro average f1 score on train and validation data: 
𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐫𝐨 𝐀𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐅1 𝐒𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐞(𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚)= 0.8227 
𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐫𝐨 𝐀𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐅1 𝐒𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐞(𝐕𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚)= 0.8254
As for train and validation data, the Macro average F1 scores are close and comparable so no overfitting problem. 

Methods Used: VLOOKUP and PIVOT TABLE

The work is done under the guidance of Nishant Sir and Mahima Ma'am from DataPlay... I am thankful to my mentors and co-interns for helping me with this project. 😊
